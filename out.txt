Open a sql shell running against a cockroach database.

Usage:
  cockroach sql [options] [flags]

Flags:
      --cert-principal-map strings   
                                      A comma separated list of <cert-principal>:<db-principal> mappings. This
                                      allows mapping the principal in a cert to a DB principal such as "node" or
                                      "root" or any SQL user. This is intended for use in situations where the
                                      certificate management system places restrictions on the Subject.CommonName or
                                      SubjectAlternateName fields in the certificate (e.g. disallowing a CommonName
                                      such as "node" or "root"). If multiple mappings are provided for the same
                                      <cert-principal>, the last one specified in the list takes precedence. A
                                      principal not specified in the map is passed through as-is via the identity
                                      function. A cert is allowed to authenticate a DB principal if the DB principal
                                      name is contained in the mapped CommonName or DNS-type SubjectAlternateName
                                      fields. It is permissible for the <cert-principal> string to contain colons.
                                     
      --certs-dir string             
                                      Path to the directory containing SSL certificates and keys.
                                      Environment variable: COCKROACH_CERTS_DIR
                                      (default "/home/vscode/.cockroach-certs")
  -d, --database string              
                                      The name of the database to connect to.
                                      Environment variable: COCKROACH_DATABASE
                                     
      --debug-sql-cli                
                                      Simplify the SQL CLI to ease troubleshooting of CockroachDB issues. This
                                      echoes sent SQL, removes the database name and txn status from the prompt, and
                                      forces behavior to become independent on current transaction state. Equivalent
                                      to --echo-sql, \unset check_syntax and \set prompt1 %n@%M>.
                                     
      --echo-sql                     
                                      Reveal the SQL statements sent implicitly by the command-line utility.
                                     
      --embedded                     
                                      Simplify and reduce the SQL CLI output to make it appropriate for embedding in
                                      a 'playground'-type environment.  This causes the shell to omit informational
                                      message about aspects that can only be changed with command-line flags or
                                      environment variables: in an embedded environment, the user has no control
                                      over these and the messages would thus be confusing.  It also causes the shell
                                      to omit informational messages about networking details (e.g. server address),
                                      as it is assumed that the embedding environment will report those instead.
                                     
  -e, --execute <stmtlist>           
                                      Execute the SQL statement(s) on the command line, then exit. This flag may
                                      be specified multiple times and each value may contain multiple semicolon
                                      separated statements. If an error occurs in any statement, the command exits
                                      with a non-zero status code and further statements are not executed. The
                                      results of each SQL statement are printed on the standard output.  This flag
                                      is incompatible with --file / -f.
                                     
  -f, --file string                  
                                      Read and execute the SQL statement(s) from the specified file. The file is
                                      processed as if it has been redirected on the standard input of the shell. 
                                      This flag is incompatible with --execute / -e.
                                     
      --format string                
                                      Selects how to display table rows in results. Possible values: tsv, csv,
                                      table, records, ndjson, json, sql, html, raw. If left unspecified, defaults to
                                      tsv for non-interactive sessions and table for interactive sessions.
                                      (default "tsv")
  -h, --help                         help for sql
      --insecure                     
                                      Connect to a cluster without using TLS nor authentication. This makes the
                                      client-server connection vulnerable to MITM attacks. Use with care.
                                      Environment variable: COCKROACH_INSECURE
                                     
      --no-line-editor               
                                      Force disable the interactive line editor. Can help during testing.
                                     
      --read-only                    
                                      Set the session variable default_transaction_read_only to on.
                                     
      --safe-updates                 
                                      Disable SQL statements that may have undesired side effects. For example a
                                      DELETE or UPDATE without a WHERE clause. By default, this setting is enabled
                                      (true) and such statements are rejected to prevent accidents. This can also be
                                      overridden in a session with SET sql_safe_updates = FALSE.
                                      (default <unspecified>)
      --set <stmtlist>               
                                      Set a client-side configuration parameter before running the SQL shell. This
                                      flag may be specified multiple times.
                                     
      --url <postgres://...>         
                                      Connection URL, of the form:
                                         postgresql://[user[:passwd]@]host[:port]/[db][?parameters...]
                                      For example, postgresql://myuser@localhost:26257/mydb.
                                     
                                      If left empty, the discrete connection flags are used: host, port, user,
                                      database, insecure, certs-dir.
                                      Environment variable: COCKROACH_URL
                                     
  -u, --user string                  
                                      Database user name.
                                      Environment variable: COCKROACH_USER
                                      (default "root")
      --watch duration               
                                      Repeat the SQL statement(s) specified with --execute with the specified
                                      period. The client will stop watching if an execution of the SQL statement(s)
                                      fail.

Global Flags:
      --enterprise-require-fips-ready      abort if FIPS readiness checks fail
      --log <string>                       
                                            Logging configuration, expressed using YAML syntax. For example, you can
                                            change the default logging directory with: --log='file-defaults: {dir: ...}'.
                                            See the documentation for more options and details.  To preview how the log
                                            configuration is applied, or preview the default configuration, you can use
                                            the 'cockroach debug check-log-config' sub-command.
                                           
      --log-config-file <file>             
                                            File name to read the logging configuration from. This has the same effect as
                                            passing the content of the file via the --log flag.
                                            (default <unset>)
      --log-config-vars strings            
                                            Environment variables that will be expanded if present in the body of the
                                            logging configuration.
                                           
      --log-dir <string>                   
                                            --log-dir=XXX is an alias for --log='file-defaults: {dir: XXX}'.
                                           
      --logtostderr <severity>[=DEFAULT]   
                                            --logtostderr=XXX is an alias for --log='sinks: {stderr: {filter: XXX}}'. If
                                            no value is specified, the default value for the command is inferred: INFO for
                                            server commands, WARNING for client commands.
                                            (default UNKNOWN)
      --redactable-logs                    
                                            --redactable-logs=XXX is an alias for --log='file-defaults: {redactable:
                                            XXX}}'.
                                           
      --vmodule moduleSpec                 comma-separated list of pattern=N settings for file-filtered logging (significantly hurts performance)
